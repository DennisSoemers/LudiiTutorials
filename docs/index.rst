Welcome to Ludii's Tutorials!
=============================

Ludii is a general game system designed to play, evaluate and design a wide range of games, including board games, card games, dice games, mathematical games, 
and so on. Download the Ludii player to explore our ever-growing database of games, test your AI search algorithms, and design your own games.

Games are described as structured sets of ludemes (units of game-related information). This allows the full range of traditional strategy games from around the world 
to be modelled in a single playable database. Ludii is being developed as part of the ERC-funded `Digital Ludeme Project <http://www.ludeme.eu/>`_.
